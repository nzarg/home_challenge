If you are planning to run playbook.yml on multiple servers simultaneously, I suggest creating an SSH key on your computer (control node) and copying that SSH key into the Site Host Control Panel -> SSH Keys. By doing this, when you create new VPS instances, you can include those keys in your VPS.

You can view all the SSH keys on your computer using the following command:

bash
Copy code
ls -la ~/.ssh
To view and copy the content of id_ed25519.pub, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
If you want to create a new SSH key on your computer (control node), follow these steps:

To make it easier for you, I have provided a sample IP address (128.128.128.128) in the following commands. Remember to replace it with the actual IP address of the target host.

Generate a key with a passphrase:

arduino
Copy code
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C 'user default'
Create a key for Ansible with no passphrase:

mathematica
Copy code
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "ansible"
List all your keys:

bash
Copy code
ls -la ~/.ssh
Display the key in the terminal:

bash
Copy code
cat ~/.ssh/ansible.pub
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
In case you forgot to select to include your SSH key when creating your VPS, these commands can help you copy your SSH keys from your computer to the target host:

Copy to target host:

javascript
Copy code
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub 128.128.128.128
Copy to target host:

javascript
Copy code
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/ansible.pub 128.128.128.128
To ensure that your control node is up to date, run the command ansible-playbook install_on_control_node.yml. Please note that this feature has not been tested yet.

Before proceeding, make sure to configure the inventory file with the IP addresses where you want to install this software.

Later, you will need to configure your API_KEY and add the IP addresses to the appropriate section.

Finally, execute the playbook.yml file.

Overall, your English is quite clear. I made some minor changes for clarity and improved the formatting of the commands.
